# Project Description

This project will get posts from the Reddit API (r/memes/top) and display them on a list. You can click those elements to open the details panel/drawer which will provide a large image preview. You can also dismiss posts (they'll get back on browser reload), mark them as read and save images as favourites (this is persisted in local storage and will be mantained even if you reload the page or close the browser). You can also switch between Light and Dark Mode (also persisted).

- Material UI for UI styling and elements
- Redux for state management
- redux-persist to persist config (dark mode, read posts and saved images from posts)
- redux-saga for async data fetching
- reselect for Redux state selectors

**Post MVP note: there are several todo items through out the code, the most important ones are to add "Load More" capabilities, animations in the list, a drawer that shows your saved images and unit tests.**

Just run `npm install` and `npm start` to check it out in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can also check a working demo in [https://still-beach-06604.herokuapp.com/](https://still-beach-06604.herokuapp.com/).

# Create React App README

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
